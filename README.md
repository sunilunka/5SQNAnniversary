##### Introduction

 This is a small project to create an landing and registration page for the 5 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force Anniversary event in 2016.

 ##### Objectives

 To create a page that:

 1. Provides potential users with an app to register their interest in attending event(s) associated with these milestones.

 2. Provides a space for organizers to update registered users about the events.

 3. Allows organizers to engage with registered users, without necessarily using email.

 4. Provide a platform for future public interaction between the squadron and general public.

 #### Architecture

 Making use of firebase and AngularJS (AngularFire). This is due to the short time frame for building the site.
